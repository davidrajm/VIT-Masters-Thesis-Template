\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
This chapter should summarize the key aspects of your project (failures as well as successes) and should state the conclusions you have been able to draw.  Outline what you would do if given more time (future work).  Try to pinpoint any insights your project uncovered that might not have been obvious at the outset.  Discuss the success of the approach you adopted and the academic objectives you achieved.  Avoid meaningless conclusions, [e.g. NOT `` I learnt a lot about C++ programming ''].  Be realistic about potential future work.  Avoid the dreaded: ``All the objectives have been met and the project has been a complete success''.  You have to crisply state the main take-away points from your work.  Describe how your project is performed against planned outputs and performance targets.  Identify the benefits from the project.  Be careful to distinguish what you have done from what was there already.  It is also a good idea to point out how much more is waiting to be done in relation to a specific problem, or give suggestions for improvement or extensions to what you have done.  
Future scope of the work for improvement may also be included
