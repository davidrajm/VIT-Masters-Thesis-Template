\chapter{Introduction}

The introduction is a shorter version of the rest of the report, and in many cases the rest of the report can 
also have the same flow that summarizes the major contributions of the project. The chapter should provide a 
critical and concise outline of the subject to be covered by the dissertation and indicate how this study will 
contribute to the subject. This chapter should include the descriptions such as: (not necessarily in that order, 
but what is given below is a logical order). Example of a citation: \cite{bar}

	\item Challenges [Difficulty in the problem solving].
	\item Essence of your approach [Your method of problem solving].
	\item Statement of assumptions [The conditions under which your solution is applicable].  
	\item Organization of the report. 
	\item Aim(s) and Objective(s)
	\item Avoid ‘routine’ background e.g. the C programming language.
